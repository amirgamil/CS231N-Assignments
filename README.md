# CS231N-Assignments
Below are my solutions to Stanford's CS231N assignments - specifically for the Spring 2017 iteration of the course. All in all,
the course was amazing and I learned a lot. 10/10 would recommend for anyone intersted in getting practical, hands-on
experience for deep learning.

# Assignment 1
[1.](assignment1/knn.ipynb) k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. (Done)
[2.](assignment1/svm.ipynb) Training a Support Vector Machine. (Done)
[3.](assignment1/softmax.ipynb) Implement a Softmax classifier. (Done)
[4.](assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb) Two-Layer Neural Network. (Done)
[5.](assignment1/features.ipynb) Higher Level Representations: Image Features. (Done)

# Assignment 2:
