# CS231N-Assignments
Below are my solutions to Stanford's CS231N assignments - specifically for the Spring 2017 iteration of the course. All in all,
the course was amazing and I learned a lot. 10/10 would recommend for anyone intersted in getting practical, hands-on
experience for deep learning.

## Assignment 1
- [Taks 1](assignment1/knn.ipynb) k-Nearest Neighbor classifier. (Done)
- [Task 2](assignment1/svm.ipynb) Training a Support Vector Machine. (Done)
- [Task 3](assignment1/softmax.ipynb) Implement a Softmax classifier. (Done)
- [Task 4](assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb) Two-Layer Neural Network. (Done)
- [Task 5](assignment1/features.ipynb) Higher Level Representations: Image Features. (Done)

## Assignment 2:
- [Task 1](assignment2/FullyConnectedNets.ipynb) Fully-connected Neural Network. (Done)
- [Task 2](assignment2/BatchNormalization.ipynb) Batch Normalization. (Done)
- [Task 3](assignment2/Dropout.ipynb) Dropout. (Done)
- [Task 4](assignment2/ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb) Convolutional Networks. (Done)
- [Task 5](assignment2/PyTorch.ipynb) PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10. (Done)

## Assignment 3:
- [Task 1](assignment3/RNN_Captioning.ipynb) Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs. (Done)
- [Task 2](assignment3/LSTM_Captioning.ipynb) Image Captioning with LSTMs. (Done)
- [Task 3](assignment3/NetworkVisualization-PyTorch.ipynb) Network Visualization: Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images. (Done)
- [Task 4](assignment3/StyleTransfer-PyTorch.ipynb) Style Transfer. (Done)
